Given more time, what would you have done differently? 
I would have added more styling and incorporated more of the post-view page in. 

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why? N/A

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
I really like the idea of using a project to test our knowledge, but I'm worried that the time committment needed would detract future applicants since it's a big time investment for the chance to get rejected.
