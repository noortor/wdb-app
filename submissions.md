Given more time, what would you have done differently? 
I would have added more styling, incorporated more of the post-view page in, and enabled on-click routing. 

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why? N/A

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
I really like the idea of using a project to test our knowledge, but I'm worried that the time committment required would detract future applicants since it's a big time investment for the chance to get rejected. I found myself spending a lot of time learning how to do routing in Vue.js as it wasn't needed in my internship. Side note: I relate to the poetry in these posts on a deep, emotional level.
